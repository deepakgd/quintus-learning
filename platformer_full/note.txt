Tilemap design notes:
tilewidth - 70
tileheight - 70

width - 200 tiles = 200 * 70 
height - 20 tiles = 20 * 70


Minimum bottom 5 tiles required for bricks

if required give spacing x - 2 px while designing Tilemap

Sprite animation:
Must be in single Sprite sheet
Must be in single row
Must have same width and height and space spacing

Each sprite characters must be in separate file. For example,

Player all action in single sprite
Enemy 1 all action in single sprite
Enemy 2 all action in single sprite

Total 2 sprite sheets and one Tilemap
